	<p>
		forEva is the world's only by-invitation safe space for women's networks and groups.<br><br>
		
		<!-- Existing women's communities can start their own branded, exclusive zones here and use its cutting-edge tech for free. Individual women can reach beyond physical, social and professional circles and get together around mutual interests or concerns, for support, inspiration, education or just for fun.<br><br> -->
		
		At forEva, we envision a world that celebrates the uniqueness of the feminine gender: its special traits, interests, concerns, ways of thinking and interacting.<br><br> 
		
		As in fields like medicine, sanitation, fashion, where the unique physical aspects of women inspire scientific and artistic innovation, at forEva we are inspired by the unique social and behavioral traits of women, which often diverge from male constructs of social networking.<br><br>
		
		forEva's evolving design and architecture keeps these unique networking needs of women at its very heart.<br><br>
		
		As we grow, we hope you join us, as users, champions, allies and well-wishers.
